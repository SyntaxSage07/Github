    <!-- Summary -->
        <!-- We can use a <script> tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
        The type and language attributes are not required.
        A script in an external file can be inserted with <script src="path/to/script.js"></script> .
        There is much more to learn about browser scripts and their interaction with the webpage. 
        But let’s keep in mind that this part of the tutorial is devoted to the JavaScript language, 
        so we shouldn’t distract ourselves with browser-specific implementations of it. 
        We’ll be using the browser as a way to run JavaScript, which is very convenient for online reading, but only one of many. -->
